# API-REST swim OF competitions => HercÃºlea 2.0 

The Api can make CRUD with diferents endPoints.
## I used:

``NodeJs``

``Mysql with Orm Sequelize.``

``To deploy bbdd => clever-cloud.``

``FrameWork Express to building the API-REST.``

``Nodemoon to automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.``

``Yup library to validations.`` 

``Jasmine to test the APi.``

``DockerFile to make image.``



The App is listening on :

**http://localhost:4000/**

``npm i to install all dependencies.``

__To start run into the terminal:__

``npm start`` 

__To run test:__
